## **About This Site**

This is my personal website and blog, Built using ReactJS, Gatsby and Netlify.

### Home Section

This section serves as a general introduction to myself in my Professional Capacity and is essentially a digital CV, as well as a digital presence for myself which is a bit more custom and interesting than yet another soul-less corporate Linkedin page or bland PDF file.

### Blog Section

This purely serves as a place for me to write about anything that comes to mind, whether that's Technology and Programming, goings on in the Tech Sector, other topics I'm interested in outside of Software Engineering as well as general thoughts and ramblings, by no means an experts opinion.
